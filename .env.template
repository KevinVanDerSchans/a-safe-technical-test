# Do not commit the file to version control as it might contain
# sensitive information like API keys or credentials.

# Instructions:

# These variables are used for authentication purposes within the application.
# They represent a mock user ID, email and password for development and testing.
# You may define them with your own values during local development.

# Note: In a real-world scenario, authentication should be handled by a secure back-end service.
# Sensitive user data (like passwords) should never be hard-coded or stored in environment variables
# for production environments.
